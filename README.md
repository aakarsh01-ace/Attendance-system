# Face Recognition Attendance System

## What is Face recognition?
In technical terms, face recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual based on their facial features. This technology uses computer algorithms to analyze a person's facial characteristics such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the jawline, and the contour of the face to create a unique facial signature.

## Attendace System
Facial recognition systems can be used for a variety of applications, including security systems, access control, and surveillance. It is often used by law enforcement agencies in border controls to detect suspects or verify the identity of travelers. Facial recognition technology has improved in recent years and can now recognize faces in different lighting conditions, even by changes in facial expressions, facial expressions or glasses.

Our project focuses on a Attendance system based on facial recognition. Our problem was to get rid of the manual and time taking attendances, which is often taken to advantage by students in schools/colleges to get proxies.
