## What is Face recognition?
In technical terms, face recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual based on their facial features. This technology uses computer algorithms to analyze a person's facial characteristics such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the jawline, and the contour of the face to create a unique facial signature.
